# future_promise

## Make your ShinyDashboard faster

Have you ever built a Shiny app that takes quite a long time to load because of a particular component?

You would like to see other parts of your app showing even if the long time loading component hasn't load yet?

No worries, just set this component in a `future`, job will be done when workers will be available via `promises` !
